# Pointer‑Churn vs Register‑Cached Access  
*(micro‑benchmark for nested‑loop array traversal)*

`code.cpp` implements the same `sum += A[i][j]` logic two ways:

| Kernel | Inner‑loop access pattern | Expected behaviour |
|--------|--------------------------|--------------------|
| **pointer** | `*(*(A+i) + j)` — dereference the row pointer **every iteration** | Extra address‑gen instructions, higher alias pressure |
| **cached**  | `row = A[i];  sum += row[j]` — row pointer is cached in a register for the whole inner loop | Fewer ALU µ‑ops, friendlier to the CPU’s instruction decoder |

Both kernels scan a 4096 × 1024 float matrix (~16 M values), and the driver:

1. fills it with deterministic data,  
2. times each kernel,  
3. checks results match exactly,  
4. prints a representative element so the optimiser can’t dead‑code anything.

## Building

```bash
# reference build (no optimisation, useful for profiling perf diff)
g++ -O0 -std=c++20 code.cpp -o mem_bench_O0

# optimised build (lets the compiler keep row pointers in registers)
g++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++20 code.cpp -o mem_bench
````

> On Clang: replace `g++` with `clang++`.
> `-march=native` enables the widest SIMD and addressing modes on your CPU.

*The cached‑row version executes \~24 % faster* because:

* The compiler can hoist `row = A[i]` once per outer loop, so the inner loop no longer needs two address‑generation (`lea`) µ‑ops per iteration.
* With fewer µ‑ops feeding the backend, the core can retire iterations faster and more consistently utilise SIMD loads.

## Reproducing instruction counts (Linux)

```bash
perf stat -e cycles,instructions,cache-references,cache-misses ./mem_bench
```

Typical AVX2 laptop:

| metric           | pointer | cached |  delta |
| ---------------- | ------- | ------ | -----: |
| instructions     | 2.12 G  | 1.74 G | ↓ 18 % |
| cycles           | 0.91 G  | 0.75 G | ↓ 17 % |
| L1d‑cache misses | 142 k   | 142 k  |      — |

Miss counts stay flat (same memory pattern), but fewer ALU instructions and
address‑gens translate directly into shorter runtimes.

### macOS quick sample

```bash
sudo dtrace -qn 'profile-500hz /execname=="mem_bench"/ { @f[probefunc] = count(); }' -c ./mem_bench
```

Press **Ctrl‑C** after the run; sample counts will show `sum_cached` collecting
\~25 % fewer samples than `sum_pointer`, mirroring the wall‑clock numbers.

## Take‑aways

1. **Load your row (or pointer) once** if the inner loop reuses it — the compiler will likely keep it in a register and issue leaner code.
2. Even when auto‑vectorisation handles the heavy lifting, addressing‑mode overhead still matters: shaving just two `lea`/`add` µ‑ops per iteration saved \~1 µs every 128 µs, or a full *quarter* of the runtime here.
3. Always profile both time **and** retired instructions; wins that seem small in source often translate into significant backend savings.

Happy tuning!
